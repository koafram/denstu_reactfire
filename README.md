# dentsu_reactfire
A task management tool with ReactFire

## Instructions

This initiative is meant to gauge your technical capabilities further. The only prerequisite for this project is using https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/reactfire within your codebase. We encourage creativity and expansion on the base functionality in a theme of your preference. This could be a simple chat application, a local event directory, a task management tool, or an expense tracker. The choice of application theme is fully yours and serves both as a part of the interview process and a learning opportunity.
